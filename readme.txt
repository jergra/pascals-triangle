this is the tutorial:
    I Have Only One Javascript Question

    by Dave Gray

It builds a Pascal's Triangle. 
It is an algorithm question regularily used in job interviews. 
Dave Gray's solution is index.html.
My solution is pascal.html.

To update:
    make changes locally
    git add . 
    git commit -m "message"
    git push    

For my solution I borrowed some code that renders console.log output
directly to the page. This was so that I could access the state of the
array at each iteration in order to render that row, since otherwise I 
could only access the array's final state at algorithm completion.
(i.e. only the bottom row of the triangle).
Dave Gray deals with this problem in a much better way.
