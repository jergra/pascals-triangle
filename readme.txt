this is the tutorial:
    I Have Only One Javascript Question

    by Dave Gray

It builds a Pascal's Triangle. 
It is an algorithm question regularily used in job interviews. 
Dave Gray's solution is index.html.
My solution is pascal.html. 
Whichever solution is highlighted is the one that will run 
when 'Go Live' (bottom right of vscode) is pressed.

For my solution I borrowed some code that renders console.log output
directly to the page. This was so that I could access the state of the
array at each iteration in order to render that row, since otherwise I 
could only access the array's final state at algorithm completion.
(i.e. only the bottom row of the triangle).
Dave Gray deals with this problem in a much better way.
